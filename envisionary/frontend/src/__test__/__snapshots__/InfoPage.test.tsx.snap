      Envision the world through the eyes of a traveller
    </h1>
    <br />
    Humans are only given a limited amount of time to explore and experience the world. How can we spend that time wisely?
    <br />
     
    <br />
    At Envisionary, we believe that travellers should travel 
    <div
      className="MuiBox-root css-1fcemm1"
    >
      knowingly
    </div>
    . 
    <br />
    We therefore aim to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience between travellers.
    <br />
    <br />
    Our concept is simple: search for the countries you are interested in and read the experiences of other travellers. 
    <br />
    And if you want to enlighten other envisionaries: review the countries you have been to.
    <br />
    <br />
    Envisionaries know that informed choices are better choices. Safe travels!
    <br />
